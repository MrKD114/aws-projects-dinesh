# AWS Projects by Dinesh K

This repository contains a series of AWS projects and use cases developed to demonstrate practical knowledge of cloud services and architecture design. Each project is structured to reflect real-world implementation scenarios commonly required in cloud-based application development.

The projects cover topics such as identity and access management, compute services, monitoring and alerting, infrastructure as code, serverless computing, and event-driven workflows.

Each folder in the repository includes:
- Detailed implementation steps
- Source code and scripts (where applicable)
- Architecture explanations
- Optional project files or documentation

## Purpose
This repository serves as a public portfolio of my AWS hands-on experience and may be used for:
- Demonstrating my understanding of AWS services and practical implementation
- Sharing reusable patterns with the developer community
- Showcasing my skills to potential employers and collaborators

## Repository Structure
Each use case is organized into a dedicated folder containing relevant code, documentation, and a README file.
