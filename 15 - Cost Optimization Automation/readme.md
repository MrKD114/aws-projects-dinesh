# Cost Optimization Automation using AWS Cost Explorer API

This use case automates the process of analyzing AWS cost data and sending insights via email. It uses the Cost Explorer API to identify underutilized resources and Simple Email Service (SES) to send a summarized report.

## Overview

The goal is to reduce unnecessary spending by automatically scanning usage patterns, identifying cost-saving opportunities, and notifying stakeholders.

## Steps Implemented

1. **Cost Explorer API Setup**
   - Queried AWS Cost Explorer API to fetch daily/weekly/monthly cost and usage data.
   - Filtered by services, tags, and usage types to identify high-cost or idle resources.

2. **Analysis Logic**
   - Processed the cost data to spot patterns like:
     - Idle EC2 instances.
     - Underutilized volumes or snapshots.
     - Low utilization thresholds.

3. **Generate Cost Report**
   - Converted insights into a readable report (text or PDF format).
   - Included resource identifiers, cost impact, and optimization suggestions.

4. **Send Report via SES**
   - Configured AWS SES to send the cost report to specified email recipients.
   - Ensured SES email identities were verified.

5. **Scheduled Execution (Optional)**
   - Used a CloudWatch rule to invoke the script/Lambda daily or weekly.

## Key Concepts

- **Cost Optimization**: Actively reduce AWS spend with automated insights.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Make informed choices about resource scaling or termination.
- **Automation**: Reduce manual effort in analyzing AWS bills.
